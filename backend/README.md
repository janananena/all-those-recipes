# üç≤ All Those Recipes ‚Äì Backend Server

This is the backend server for **All Those Recipes**, a recipe web application. It supports image uploads, recipe/tag validation, and secure user authentication using JWTs.

---

## Features

- REST API for recipes, tags, and uploads
- JSON schema validation for recipes and tags
- Image and file uploads with resizing/compression
- User authentication (JWT-based)
- Simple user management (create, list, delete, change password)
- Auto-creates a fallback `admin` user on first startup
- Secures all endpoints except login and health check

---

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
````

### 2. Run locally (with Docker or Node)

#### Option A: Node.js

```bash
node server.js
```

#### Option B: Docker

Make sure your Docker setup binds volumes if needed.

---

## Authentication

* The server uses **JWT tokens** for securing endpoints.

* On first run (if no users exist), a default user is created:

  ```
  Username: admin
  Password: password
  ```

* This user is **removed** automatically when the first new user is created.
